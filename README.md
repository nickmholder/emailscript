# emailscript
First edition email script
This is the first edition of an email script I was working on to streamline sending emails to potential affilaites with the company I currently work with.

I found myself sending 100-300 emails by hand reaching out to potential affialites and decided to look into creating a python script that would do it manually for me.

All you need is a CSV file with the "Name" and "Email".

I also attached a PDF of the brand we were trying to promote, so it would automatically attach it to gmail and send it along with the message.
